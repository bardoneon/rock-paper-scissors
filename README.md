Rock paper scissors game.
Fist JS project I make on my own.

In rock / paper / scissors two players face off head to head. Each one of them has three possible weapons:

- Rock
- Paper
- Scissors

Each one of this weapons beats one other, loses against another and ties with itself:

- Rock smashes scissors, gets covered by paper and ties against rock.
- Paper covers rock, gets cut by paper and ties against paper.
- Scissors cut paper, gets smashed by rock and ties against scissors.

Game is going to have a duration of 5 rounds. In this version, a human player faces off the PC.

Game should display result of each round, and winner / loser after the determined rounds (5). Ideally it would also display the partial score, xe: 2 - 1.
